// Custom Virus Realistic Workflow for Tokyo

// Step 1: Design a new synthetic virus from a custom protein sequence.
// This creates a hypothetical virus not found in nature.
Chimera_Virus = design(name: "Chimera-7", protein: "MGSK*");

// Step 2: Create a very large, dense population representing a megacity like Tokyo.
// We'll use 2000 agents to simulate a more challenging scenario.
Tokyo = create population(name: "Tokyo", size: 2000, verbose: true);

// Step 3: Calibrate the model for a highly aggressive and transmissible virus.
// We'll aim for an explosive outbreak where the peak infected count
// reaches 40% of the total population (800 agents).
CalibratedTokyo = Tokyo calibrate(target_peak_infected: 800);

// Step 4: Unleash the custom virus on the population and run the simulation.
TokyoOutbreakReport = Chimera_Virus ! CalibratedTokyo;
