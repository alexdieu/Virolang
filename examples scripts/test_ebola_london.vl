//Ebola Virus Realistic Workflow for London

// Step 1: Load the reference genome for Zaire ebolavirus from NCBI.
// This is the strain responsible for the deadliest Ebola outbreaks.
Ebola_Zaire = load_genome(id: "NC_002549.1");

// Step 2: Create a large, dense urban population representing London.
// We'll use 1,500 agents and keep verbose logging enabled.
London = create population(name: "London", size: 1500, verbose: true);

// Step 3: Calibrate the model against a severe but focused outbreak scenario.
// Ebola's transmission dynamics often lead to intense clusters rather than
// widespread infection. We'll target a peak of 100 infected agents.
CalibratedLondon = London calibrate(target_peak_infected: 100);

// Step 4: Unleash the calibrated Ebola virus simulation on the London population.
EbolaOutbreakReport = Ebola_Zaire ! CalibratedLondon;
